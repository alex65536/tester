.SH NAME
tsrun \(em a command-line tool to test problems with \fBTester\fR.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tsrun \fIproblem-work-dir\fR \fIproblem-props-file\fR \fItest-src\fR \fIres-file\fR [\fItest-dir-name\fR] [\fItimeout\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTsRun\fR is a command-line frontend for \fBTester\fR. The purpose of \fBTsRun\fR is to allow testing problems automatically (e. g. from other program or a shell script). Testing results are available in JSON format.

\fBTsRun\fR will load a problem from \fIproblem-props-file\fR with working directory
\fIproblem-work-dir\fR. It will test source file \fItest-src\fR and write the results
into \fIres-file\fR.

\fBTsRun\fR will update \fIres-file\fR file each time when something is changed (e.g. the tested program passes a test), so you can try to read the file permanently to retrieve the updates. When the changes are being made, the file is locked.

If \fItest-dir-name\fR is set, the testing will be held in directory with the
path $TMP/\fItest-dir-name\fR. If not set, \fItest-dir-name\fR will be chosen by \fBTsRun\fR randomly.

\fItimeout\fR indicates what time \fBTsRun\fR will be idle after each change, so you can
read the results from the file.
